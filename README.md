We have released a challenging [Gymnasium](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/) compatible
environment. The best strategy for this environment is to have both episodic and semantic
memory systems. See the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i1.25075) for more information.

## Prerequisites

1. A unix or unix-like x86 machine
1. python 3.8 or higher.
1. Running in a virtual environment (e.g., conda, virtualenv, etc.) is highly recommended so that you don't mess up with the system python.
1. This env is added to the PyPI server. Just run: `pip install room-env`

## RoomEnv-v1

```python
import gymnasium as gym
import room_env
import random

env = gym.make("RoomEnv-v1")
observation, info = env.reset()
rewards = 0

while True:
    # There is one different thing in the RoomEnv from the original AAAI-2023 paper:
    # The reward is either +1 or -1, instead of +1 or 0.
    observation, reward, done, truncated, info = env.step(random.randint(0, 2))
    rewards += reward
    if done:
        break

print(rewards)
```

Every time when an agent takes an action, the environment will give you three memory
systems (i.e., episodic, semantic, and short-term), as an `observation`. The goal of the
agent is to learn a memory management policy. The actions are:

- 0: Put the short-term memory into the episodic memory system.
- 1: Put it into the semantic.
- 2: Just forget it.

The memory systems will be managed according to your actions, and they will eventually
be used to answer questions. You don't have to worry about the question answering. It's done
by the environment. The better you manage your memory systems, the higher chances that
your agent can answer more questions correctly!

The default parameters for the environment are

```json
{
    "des_size": "l",
    "seed": 42,
    "policies": {"encoding": "argmax",
                "memory_management": "RL",
                "question_answer": "episodic_semantic"},
    "capacity": {"episodic": 16, "semantic": 16, "short": 1},
    "question_prob": 1.0,
    "observation_params": "perfect",
    "allow_random_human": False,
    "allow_random_question": False,
    "total_episode_rewards": 128,
    "pretrain_semantic": False,
    "check_resources": True,
    "varying_rewards": False
}
```

If you want to create an env with a different set of parameters, you can do so. For example:

```python
env_params = {"seed": 0,
              "capacity": {"episodic": 8, "semantic": 16, "short": 1},
              "pretrain_semantic": True}
env = gym.make("RoomEnv-v1", **env_params)
```

Take a look at [this repo](https://github.com/tae898/explicit-memory) for an actual
interaction with this environment to learn a policy.

## Data collection

Data is collected from querying ConceptNet APIs. For simplicity, we only collect triples
whose format is (`head`, `AtLocation`, `tail`). Here `head` is one of the 80 MS COCO
dataset categories. This was kept in mind so that later on we can use images as well.

If you want to collect the data manually, then run below:

```
python collect_data.py
```

## [The RoomDes](room_env/des.py)

The DES is part of RoomEnv. You don't have to care about how it works. If you are still
curious, you can read below.

You can run the RoomDes by

```python
from room_env.des import RoomDes

des = RoomDes()
des.run(debug=True)
```

with `debug=True` it'll print events (i.e., state changes) to the console.

```console
{'resource_changes': {'desk': -1, 'lap': 1},
 'state_changes': {'Vincent': {'current_time': 1,
                               'object_location': {'current': 'desk',
                                                   'previous': 'lap'}}}}
{'resource_changes': {}, 'state_changes': {}}
{'resource_changes': {}, 'state_changes': {}}
{'resource_changes': {},
 'state_changes': {'Michael': {'current_time': 4,
                               'object_location': {'current': 'lap',
                                                   'previous': 'desk'}},
                   'Tae': {'current_time': 4,
                           'object_location': {'current': 'desk',
                                               'previous': 'lap'}}}}
```

  abstractNote={Inspired by the cognitive science theory of the explicit human memory systems, we have modeled an agent with short-term, episodic, and semantic memory systems, each of which is modeled with a knowledge graph. To evaluate this system and analyze the behavior of this agent, we designed and released our own reinforcement learning agent environment, “the Room”, where an agent has to learn how to encode, store, and retrieve memories to maximize its return by answering questions. We show that our deep Q-learning based agent successfully learns whether a short-term memory should be forgotten, or rather be stored in the episodic or semantic memory systems. Our experiments indicate that an agent with human-like memory systems can outperform an agent without this memory structure in the environment.},
